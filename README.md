# This Is My Landing Page
In this landing page you will find a video introduction, a quick bio, and a link to my portfolio page.
## How to Run:
Start by downloading all files in the same folder on your machine. Load the index.html file in your browser.
You can also navigate directly to my landing page by using this link https://mmastrullo.github.io/
## Future Improvements:
My hope is that as I complete new coding projects I will add them to the project page.
## License Information:
The projects are licensed under the MIT License.
